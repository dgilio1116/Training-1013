						<center><b>Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC)</b></center>
						<br /><br />
						A Mutual Legal Reserve Company and an Independent Licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, is the largest customer-owned health insurer in the United States and fourth largest overall, operating through our Blue Cross and Blue Shield® Plans in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. HCSC affiliates and subsidiaries such as Dearborn National, TMG Health and Medecision, offer group life, disability and dental solutions, as well as a range of other individual solutions.
						<br />						
						The company, founded in 1936, serves more than 15 million members across five states and employs more than 22,000 people in over 60 local offices.
						<br />
						HCSC is dedicated to expanding access to high quality, cost effective health care and equipping our members with information and tools so they can make the best healthcare decisions for themselves and their families. Our health plans were pioneers in their states, as they were the first to provide coverage for a number of procedures — ranging from heart and bone marrow transplants, to cancer and leukemia treatments. Today, we are leaders in the development of value-based care models to spur greater collaboration and accountability among various stakeholders to improve the health care experience for patients and consumers and enable them lead healthier lives.
						<br />
						HCSC is dedicated to contributing to the well-being of the communities in which our employees and members live, work and play. We continue our longstanding tradition of community support through charitable investments with community partners, volunteerism, civic engagement, event sponsorship, employee giving, donation drives and in-kind donations.
